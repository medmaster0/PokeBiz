POKEMON BATTLE CHAIN:
send pokemon up to server in single file
Pokemon battle one by one on server
once one falls, next takes his place
(the one who takes his place gets to go first so main one always gets hit)
until other's chain is exhausted
one winner left
two chains to subscribe to: magma and aqua?
real time pokemon battles on server!!!

BATTLE SYSTEM (very simple)
Pokemon's lvl is atk and hp
Speed: Higher level higher the CHANCE that you go first
Type advantage gives double the attack
HP is recovered with berries?
>>Each pokemon has fave berry
>>fave berry recovers full HP
>>fave berry is required to revive
If pokemon wins he advances one level (or 3 if other pokemon is higher)
>>Player's Pokemon start at lvl 5
>>wild at level one

--->send someone a challenge: one pookemon to one pokemon
