POKEMON BATTLE CHAIN:
send pokemon up to server in single file
Pokemon battle one by one on server
once one falls, next takes his place
(the one who takes his place gets to go first so main one always gets hit)
until other's chain is exhausted
one winner left
two chains to subscribe to: magma and aqua?
real time pokemon battles on server!!!

BATTLE SYSTEM (very simple)
Pokemon's lvl is atk and hp
Speed: Higher level higher the CHANCE that you go first
Type advantage gives double the attack
HP is recovered with berries?
>>Each pokemon has fave berry
>>fave berry recovers full HP
>>fave berry is required to revive
If pokemon wins he advances one level (or 3 if other pokemon is higher)
>>Player's Pokemon start at lvl 5
>>wild at level one

Anyone can challenge anyones pokemon: 
--->send someone a challenge: one pookemon to one pokemon
--->Sends a copy of their pokemon
--->when person recieves challenge they enter fight
--->IF lose, pokemon faints
--->If win, send faint signal to challenger
--->when challenger logs in, his pokemon faints

--->"Customers will be team gang members
--->you run into regular npcs and jump them and steal their secrets (mail)?

Broadcast BATTLE MECHANISM
Players send pokemon to online queue
At set time increments, top of queue is broadcast out
Everyone listening in challenges that pokemon
first person to win sends signal to server?
this triggers the next in the queue
(while others are battling same defeated pokemon,
they ignore any further broadcasted challenges)
Maybe, just periodically broadcast a different poke
